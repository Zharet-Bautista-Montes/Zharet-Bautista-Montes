## Hi there 👋🏽 I'm Zharet, and welcome to my projects portfolio 👌🏽

I live in Bogotá, Colombia, and I am recently graduated in Systems and Computing Engineering at the University of Andes. 

The fields I intend to work in are Information Security in general, IT Infrastructure, Systems Administration, Cryptography, Research in Computer Science and Systems Modeling. I'm also interested in Ethical Hacking, Informatics applied to Biomedical contexts and Data Analytics for Cybersecurity. I'm just starting in this thrilling,  interesting and challenging career path, so please wih me luck! 🤞🏽

🔭 I got a job since November 2022 as Information Security Consultant at CYTE®; but before that, I've been working on my personal brand (Resumé, LinkedIn and this GitHub) .  

🌱 I’m currently learning Infrastructure, some programming languages like Haskell and Red Team topics. I'm also improving in English and German. 

👯 I’m looking to resume the research I've done for my thesis, and which I had to pause because of burnout. 

⚡ Fun fact: My favorite spare time activities are eating, learning languages, reading articles, listening podcasts and playing Plants vs Zombies 2.
